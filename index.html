YOU'RE the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw! I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands. I've made a huge tiny mistake.</p>
          <p>Friend of mine from college. He also has a boat tho not called the Seaward. Oh Gob, the tears just aren't coming. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Let the great experiment begin! No, Pop-pop does not get a treat.</p>
